This repository contains a template for blueprint-driven formalization projects in Lean 4.

## Tutorial Talk Video

This is the video recording of the tutorial talk I presented at the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics ([HIM](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/him)) in Bonn.

It was designed for mathematicians at all levels to provide a comprehensive introduction to the design, management, and implementation of blueprint-driven formalisation projects in Lean, with almost no prerequisite knowledge of Git, GitHub, continuous integration systems, and other technical tools.

## Clone this Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, please refer to the relevant section of the GitHub documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

## Repository Layout

The template repository is organized as follows (listing the main folders and files):

- [`.github`](.github) contains GitHub-specific configuration files and workflows.
    - [`workflows`](.github/workflows) contains GitHub Actions workflow files.
        - [`lint.yml`](.github/workflows/lint.yml) is the style lint workflow triggered on push
        and pull request events.
    - [`dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml) is the configuration file to automate CI dependency
    updates.
- [`.vscode`](.vscode) contains Visual Studio Code configuration files
    - [`extensions.json`](.vscode/extensions.json) recommends VS Code extensions for the project.
    - [`settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json) defines the project-specific settings for VS Code.
- [`Project`](Project) should contain the Lean code files.
    - [`Mathlib`](Project/Mathlib) should contain `.lean` files with declarations missing from
    existing Mathlib developments.
    - [`ForMathlib`](Project/ForMathlib) should contain `.lean` files with new declarations to
    be upstreamed to Mathlib.
    - [`Example.lean`](Project/Example.lean) is a sample Lean file.
- [`scripts`](scripts) contains scripts to update Mathlib ensuring that the latest version is fetched and integrated into the development environment.
- [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git.
and environment.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) should provide the guidelines for contributing to the
project.
- [`lakefile.toml`](lakefile.toml) is the configuration file for the Lake build system used in
Lean projects.
- [`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain) specifies the Lean version and toolchain used for the project.

## Customize this Template

To tailor this template to your specific project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your terminal is in the project directory by running the following command:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
2.	Execute the customization script by running:
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/customize_template.py NewProject
    ```
    where `NewProject` must be replaced by the name of your project.

The script [`customize_template.py`](scripts/customize_template.py) will automatically rename the project folder and update the necessary files and configurations to match the new project name.

For more examples of completed and ongoing Lean projects and libraries, please
see the [Lean Reservoir](https://reservoir.lean-lang.org).

### 1. Install Dependencies

Verify your Python installation by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

and your Pip installation by running:

```bash
pip3 --version
```

If you don't have a Python environment, you can install one by following the instructions in the
[Python installation guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install the necessary dependencies, follow the instructions in the
[PyGraphViz installation guide](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html).

### 2. Install LeanBlueprint Package

Assuming you have a properly configured Python environment, install LeanBlueprint by running:

```bash
pip install leanblueprint
```

If you have an existing installation of LeanBlueprint, you can upgrade to the latest version by
running:

```bash
pip install -U leanblueprint
```

### 3. Configure Blueprint

To set up the blueprint for your project, run:

```bash
leanblueprint new
```

Then, follow the prompts and answer the questions as you like, except for a few specific
questions which should be answered as indicated below to ensure compatibility with this template.

Respond affirmatively with `y` to the following prompt:

```console
Proceed with blueprint creation? [y/n]
```

Respond affirmatively with `y` to the following prompt:

```console
Modify lakefile and lake-manifest to allow checking declarations exist? [y/n] (y)
```

Respond affirmatively with `y` to the following prompt:

```console
Modify lakefile and lake-manifest to allow building the documentation? [y/n] (y):
```

If you want to generate a Jekyll-based home page for the project, respond
affirmatively with `y` to the following prompt:

```console
Do you want to create a home page for the project, with links to the blueprint, the API documentation and the repository? [y/n]:
```

Respond affirmatively with `y` to the following prompt:

```console
Configure continuous integration to compile blueprint? [y/n] (y):
```

For more details about the LeanBlueprint package and its commands, please refer to its
[documentation](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint/tree/master#starting-a-blueprint).

After configuring the blueprint, please wait for the GitHub Action workflow to finish.
You can keep track of the progress in the **Actions** tab of your repository.
